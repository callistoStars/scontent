*\tTo paste that line, use the 'puts command,' by pressing 'p' at the desired line.\n	
*\t\n
*\tTo copy a word, hover over the word and press 'yw'\n	
*\t\n
*\tTo copy to the end of the line press 'y$'\n

*\tAll text removed by those commands gets copied to the clipboard so you\n
*\tcan think of the delete commands as the 'cut' feature. Anything you delete\n	
*\tcan be pasted with the puts command.\n
